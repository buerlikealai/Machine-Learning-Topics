# Multi-temporal-filtering-Sigma-Lee

I created this module for the student project during my master study. 

To install locally, just download the juypter notebook. 

The complex noise reduction for a target amplitude image is carried out based on a time series of amplitude images.

This implimetation of multi-temporal filter is based on this paper: https://ftp.space.dtu.dk/pub/Ioana/papers/s244_1wegm.pdf.
